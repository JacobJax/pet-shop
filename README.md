### Future Improvements üèó 

1. **M-Pesa daraja API intergration** - The project would go well with inclusion of payment service from example MPESA

1. **Handle database race condition** - An improvement on the project would be to handle a race condition caused by two users chosing the same pet at the same time

1. **Include Pictures**(Comming soon) - Pictures will be a good adition to the UI/UX
